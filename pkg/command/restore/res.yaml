short: Schedule a restore (ad-hoc or scheduled)

long: |
  This command allows you to schedule or run ad-hoc cluster restore.

batch-size: |
  Number of SSTables per shard to process in one request by one node.
  Increasing batch size increases job granularity.

parallel: |
  The maximum number of Scylla restore jobs that can be run at the same time (on different SSTables).
  Each node can take part in at most one restore at any given moment.

dry-run: |
  Validates and displays restore information without actually scheduling the restore.
  This allows you to display what will happen should the restore run with the parameters you set.
